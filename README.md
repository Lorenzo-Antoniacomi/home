Greetings,

I'm Lorenzo, and I've recently plunged into the dynamic realm of data science, ready to tackle new challenges and expand my expertise.

Actively pursuing knowledge expansion, I've enrolled in a Data Science bootcamp organized by Hyperion Development. The course is set to conclude in March 2024, and my journey thus far has been nothing short of riveting and inspiring.

Anticipating the course's progression, I'm eager to dive into hands-on projects. Stay tuned for regular updates on my data science exploits by following my profile.

Best,
Lorenzo
